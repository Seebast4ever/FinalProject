Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Updated player.java to correctly use the player object as an object and not as a main class. Functions were condensed into object functions versus object initiation functions.

	  -Converted player.java to settlersOfCatan.pde, a processing file. Created each hexagon (or tile) object for mouse detection during player game piece placement. Created ArrayLists for players and tiles. Compiled and debugged so the code runs and displays a blank window, for now.

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Created Settlement, Road, and City object files in processing. Created ArrayLists to track these. Changed the color and dimensions of the base game board in order to fit my screen size, and so that the asthetic is both pleasing and similar to the original game board background
