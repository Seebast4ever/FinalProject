# FinalProject
Final Project for the first semester of APCS

GIT LOG:

1-19-2016

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Updated player.java to correctly use the player object as an object and not as a main class. Functions were condensed into object functions versus object initiation functions.

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Converted player.java to settlersOfCatan.pde, a processing file. Created each hexagon (or tile) object for mouse detection during player game piece placement. Created ArrayLists for players and tiles. Compiled and debugged so the code runs and displays a blank window, for now.

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Created Settlement, Road, and City object files in processing. Created ArrayLists to track these. Changed the color and dimensions of the base game board in order to fit my screen size, and so that the asthetic is both pleasing and similar to the original game board background

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	  -Created start menu outline, edited text arrangement and color and added a button to select two players. Selecting the button will start the main file running. 

1-25-2016

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton

	-Combined code with partner, tested code to make sure it compiles/runs properly and efficiently.

      	 -Made a rough transition to processing. Working file is for some reason in initWorld2/initWorld2/ folder.
	 -Created the hexagon board with numbers in the middle that represents productivity.
	 -Created an easy way to make players hands (created a function that makes rectangles at desired location. Need to now connect each rectangle with a list of each player's hand and change color accordingly).

Chang Ju Kim
      	 -Created a rectanglular button class. In my main file (initWorld2), made it easy to do something when button is pressed.
	 -Added a die simulator
	 -Created methods to add settlements/cities/roads at specific locations.
	 	  -Bugs encountered:
		  	-Wanted to create a helper function that removes duplicate elements in an array. However, kept getting nullPointerException error. Code can be seen in makeTiles.java .
				-What I did: Simply moved the content of the function into the caller so that there were no function calls in the main function. Somehow removed the issue.


	-Tried to create a draw hexagon function directly in the hexagon class
	       -Bugs encountered:
	       	     -Like above, I got a nullPointerException error.
		     	   -What I did: I gave up.
			   	 -Notable finds: For some reason making the hexagon class have .pde extension prevents processing from seeing it as an object (despite the fact that RectButton is an object, and I... [1. created a new processing file and copy-pasted the Hexagon.java file] and [2. used mv command in terminal to change the name]).
