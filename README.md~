Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton\n
	  -Updated player.java to correctly use the player object as an object and not as a main class. Functions were condensed into object functions versus object initiation functions.

Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton\n
	  -Converted player.java to settlersOfCatan.pde, a processing file. Created each hexagon (or tile) object for mouse detection during player game piece placement. Created ArrayLists for players and tiles. Compiled and debugged so the code runs and displays a blank window, for now. 

1-21-2016\n
Sebastian Iturregui-Shelton\n
	  -Created Settlement, Road, and City object files in processing. Created ArrayLists to track these.
